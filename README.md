## Configuration

### Customizing Characters

You can modify character personalities by editing the character definitions in `streamlit_app.py`. Each character includes:
- Political ideology and beliefs
- Communication style and texting patterns
- Visual appearance (colors, emojis)
- Age and generation characteristics

### Adding New Characters

To add new characters, add them to the `characters` dictionary in the `PoliticalDebateSimulator` class with the required attributes:
- `name`: Character name
- `personality`: Political beliefs and personality
- `style`: Communication style
- `emoji`: Character emoji
- `background_color`: CSS color for message bubbles

## Output

### Web Interface Features
- **Real-time Debate Display**: Messages appear as they're generated
- **Character Styling**: Each character has unique colors and emojis
- **Side Positioning**: Characters are randomly assigned to left/right sides
- **Session Management**: Save and load debate sessions
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Session Files
Debate sessions are automatically saved and can be replayed:
- Sessions include full conversation history
- Character assignments and styling are preserved
- Easy replay functionality

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key
- Internet connection for API calls

## Dependencies

- `openai>=1.0.0` - OpenAI API client
- `python-dotenv>=0.19.0` - Environment variable management
- `streamlit>=1.28.0` - Web interface framework

## Notes

- The application uses GPT-4o by default for enhanced debate quality
- Responses are limited to maintain focused conversations
- Characters use generation-appropriate communication styles
- The interface includes modern styling with dark backgrounds and custom colors
- Stop button allows users to halt debates at any time

## Disclaimer

This application is for educational and entertainment purposes. The AI responses represent simulated political commentary and should not be taken as actual political advice or positions. The application is designed to demonstrate AI capabilities in simulating political discourse.

## Project Structure

The application has been refactored following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles with clear separation of concerns:

    â””â”€â”€ test_debate_workflow.py    # End-to-end debate workflow tests
```

### Key Components

- **Domain Layer**: Contains the core business entities and rules. The `Participant`, `Message`, and `DebateSession` models define the fundamental concepts of political debates.

- **Application Layer**: The `DebateService` orchestrates the debate workflow, coordinating between character creation, OpenAI API calls, and session management.

- **Infrastructure Layer**: The `OpenAIService` handles all external API communication with proper error handling and environment setup.

- **Presentation Layer**: Streamlit-based UI components provide a clean, responsive interface with chat-style message rendering and real-time debate visualization.

### Architecture Benefits

- **Maintability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand and modify
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested in isolation with comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Scalability**: New character types, debate formats, or UI components can be easily added
- **Reliability**: Proper error handling and logging throughout all layers

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage with both unit and integration tests:

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run all tests with coverage
python run_tests.py

# Run specific test files
python -m unittest tests.unit.test_models
python -m unittest tests.integration.test_debate_workflow
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite achieves >80% code coverage and includes:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
  - Domain model validation and behavior
  - Character factory logic
  - Stats calculation and adjustment

- **Integration Tests**: Test complete workflows
  - End-to-end debate creation and execution
  - OpenAI API integration (mocked for testing)
  - Error handling and edge cases
  - Session serialization and data persistence

### Mocking Strategy

Integration tests use mocked OpenAI API calls to:
- Avoid costs during automated testing
- Ensure consistent, predictable test results
- Test error handling scenarios
- Maintain fast test execution
