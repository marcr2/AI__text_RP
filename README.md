## Disclaimer

This application is for educational and entertainment purposes. The AI responses represent simulated political commentary and should not be taken as actual political advice or positions. The application is designed to demonstrate AI capabilities in simulating political discourse.

## Project Structure

The application has been refactored from a monolithic design into a clean, modular architecture following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). The codebase is organized into distinct layers with clear separation of concerns:

### Component Responsibilities

#### Domain Layer (`src/political_debate/domain/`)
Contains the core business logic and domain models, independent of external frameworks:

- **Models**: Defines core entities (Participant, Message, DebateSession) with business rules and validation
- **Character Factory**: Creates diverse political personalities with unique traits, speaking styles, and ideologies
- **Data Management**: Centralizes static data including character definitions, names, cities, and debate topics

#### Infrastructure Layer (`src/political_debate/infrastructure/`)
Handles external dependencies and cross-cutting concerns:

- **OpenAI Client**: Abstracts OpenAI API interactions with proper error handling and environment setup
- **API Management**: Manages API keys, request formatting, and response processing
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of API failures and network issues

#### Application Layer (`src/political_debate/application/`)
Coordinates between domain and infrastructure layers to implement use cases:

- **Debate Service**: Orchestrates the complete debate workflow from character creation to result display
- **Session Management**: Handles debate rounds, stat tracking, competitive judging, and UI coordination
- **Business Logic**: Implements debate rules, participant behavior, and outcome determination

#### Presentation Layer (`src/political_debate/presentation/`)
Handles user interface and interaction:

- **Streamlit App**: Main application entry point with clean session state management
- **UI Components**: Reusable components for message display, controls, styling, and user interaction
- **Visual Design**: Chat-style message rendering with character-specific styling and responsive layout

### Key Architectural Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a single, well-defined responsibility with minimal coupling
2. **Testability**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests with >80% coverage and extensive mocking
3. **Maintainability**: Modular design makes changes and extensions straightforward
4. **Scalability**: Clean architecture supports new character types, debate formats, and UI enhancements
5. **Reliability**: Proper error handling, logging, and graceful degradation throughout all layers
6. **Flexibility**: Abstract interfaces allow easy swapping of AI providers or UI frameworks

### Testing Strategy

The test suite follows the same architectural layers with comprehensive coverage:

- **Unit Tests (28 tests)**: Test individual components in isolation with extensive mocking
  - Domain model validation, character factory logic, and stats calculation
  - Boundary testing, error conditions, and business rule enforcement
  
- **Integration Tests (6 tests)**: Test complete workflows and component interactions
  - End-to-end debate creation and execution with mocked OpenAI API
  - Error handling scenarios, data persistence, and session management
  
- **Test Infrastructure**: Custom test runner with HTML coverage reports and CI/CD integration
- **Mocking Strategy**: Comprehensive OpenAI API mocking to avoid costs and ensure consistency
